:: Chartographer

[[Chartographer|https://chartographer.sibr.dev/]] has a number of ways to compare teams against each other in the current season - the sums and averages of team stars in each of the categories, as well as Win/Loss graphs. It's brought to you by Cheeseyx.

Note if you want something similar to the "Team Averages" scatterplots but over time, there's a nice viewer in [[Edgarware's Jupyter Notebooks|Notebooks]].

Developer discussion is at @@.channel;#projects@@ in 'Getting Involved'.
